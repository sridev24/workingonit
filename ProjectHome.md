The following libraries should be usable as is and are distributed under the Apache 2.0 license:

  * **[Cassandra4Spring](Cassandra4Spring.md)**: using Cassandra with Spring
  * **[GwtBridge](GwtBridgeProject.md)**: invoking Spring beans from a GWT application

These projects got some attention and to enable their inclusion into other software have been re-licensed under the LGPLv3 license:

  * **[Depictus](DepictusProject.md)**: Java library to generate charts, currently the Google-o-Meter one.

The projects listed below are pet projects, distributed under the GPLv3 license (if anyone cares):

  * **[Taberna](TabernaProject.md)**: looking at REST and business testing
  * **[Modulus](ModulusProject.md)**: working with a modularized Spring application
  * **[Litera](LiteraProject.md)**: keeping documentation up-to-date
  * **[Linguae](LinguaeProject.md)**: managing languages in Spring applications
  * **[Oraculum](OraculumProject.md)**: implementation of some Oracle practices
  * **[Clusterus](ClusterusProject.md)**: handling a webapp in a cluster
  * **[Configo](ConfigoProject.md)**: Swing application to manage configuration files

While testing some idea with these projects, I also:

  * write a set of [Ant antlib](http://workingonit.googlecode.com/hg/config/src/antlib) libraries so that my build scripts are ridiculously [short and simple](http://workingonit.googlecode.com/hg/clusterus/build.xml)
  * publish an [ivyroundup repository](http://workingonit.googlecode.com/hg/config/conf/roundup) for projects not already available in the main ivyroundup repository
  * develop some [Docbook templates](http://workingonit.googlecode.com/hg/config/conf/docbook) for the projects' documentation (see an [example](http://wiki.workingonit.googlecode.com/hg/clusterus.pdf))
