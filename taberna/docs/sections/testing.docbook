    <title>Testing, the RESTful way</title>

    <para>Of course it would be complete nonsense to write unit tests or integration tests with REST but business tests could be well suited for this purpose. The idea is quite simple: using a framework like Fitness or Concordion, business tests access the application via its REST interface and verify that the deployed application behaves correctly. Of course, the application may have to be started in a <emphasis>testing</emphasis> mode (meaning that external systems are mocked) but this is not too difficult to do<footnote><para>another pet project, <emphasis>Modulus</emphasis> is experimenting with this very idea</para></footnote>.</para>

    <para>As an example, the following screen shot shows a Concordion test accessing Taberna via REST. I won't go into the details but the code is trivial.</para>

        </imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para>To facilitate the tests, a custom REST client has also been developed. The fact that we are in control of both the server and the client implementations has the big advantage of keeping the test definitions quite stable.  This can make a huge difference when comes the time to do some big refactoring...</para>

    <para>Another advantage is that the tests can be shipped alongside the application and used to verify that an application has been correctly installed:</para>
